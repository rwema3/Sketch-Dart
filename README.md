Sketch
======

Sketch is a Dart package library that will ease the development of server backed single page responsive Web applications.

The objectives of this project are:

First, to build a client side layout based templating system that markup engineers will feel comfortable using, with a
routing and view system that is at the same time flexible and easy to set up, supports one and two-way binding of DOM
elements with application variables, and is easy to localize to any language.

And second, to build a server based scaffolding and persistence framework that promotes code reutilization between the
server and the client, with client side object caching and expiration rules, and support for all major cloud based
services.
